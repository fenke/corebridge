    "Wodan is a proprietary backend service that applies high performance, custom analytical processing to timeseries data in the Whysor data and dashboarding environment.\n",

    "Each wodan module defines one function that operates as the entry point. The parameter annotations in this function definition are used to format data and retrieve parameters from the originating call to the wodan api. This function is called with data retrieved according to a specification and with additional parameters as annotated.\n",
    "\n",
